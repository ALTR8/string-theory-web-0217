# String Theory

This lab has nothing to do with physics, I just really like that title. It does have to do with strings though! The objective is to make a method that sorts the characters, in descending order, in a string by the number of times each character appears in a piece of text. This lab is test driven so go ahead and run `rspec` and get those tests to pass!
